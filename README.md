Nestled along Turkey’s stunning southwestern coast, Fethiye is a true gem in the province of Muğla. Known for its turquoise waters, ancient ruins, and breathtaking natural beauty, this charming town has transformed into a hub for travelers seeking both relaxation and adventure. Whether you're a thrill-seeker, a nature lover, or someone who enjoys tranquil seaside moments, Fethiye offers a variety of experiences that cater to every taste. This article takes a closer look at what makes this town a favorite among both locals and international visitors. 

# Fethiye activities

Fethiye is not just about beaches and sunshine; it's a playground for outdoor enthusiasts and cultural explorers alike. From paragliding off Babadağ Mountain to discovering ancient Lycian tombs, Fethiye activities are both diverse and exhilarating. One of the most popular options is paragliding in Ölüdeniz. The jump from Babadağ offers a panoramic view of the turquoise lagoon below and is often regarded as one of the best paragliding sites in the world. It’s a must-do for adrenaline junkies.

If you prefer to stay closer to the ground, hiking the Lycian Way is a fantastic option. This long-distance trail stretches over 500 km and passes through Fethiye, offering spectacular coastal views and a glimpse into Turkey’s rich historical landscape. Along the way, you can visit Kayaköy, a ghost village that tells the haunting story of population exchanges in the early 20th century. Walking through its abandoned stone houses is like stepping back in time.

Fethiye’s harbor is also the starting point for various boat tours. These trips often include stops at Butterfly Valley, Blue Cave, and St. Nicholas Island. Swimming in crystal-clear coves, sunbathing on the deck, and exploring hidden beaches are some of the most enjoyable Fethiye activities to consider during your stay.

# Fethiye day trips
While Fethiye itself has a lot to offer, one of the greatest advantages of staying in this town is its proximity to numerous other attractions. The abundance of exciting Fethiye day trips makes it easy to explore the broader region without venturing too far from your base. Each excursion brings you closer to the incredible history, landscapes, and flavors of Muğla and its surroundings.

One of the most popular day trips is a visit to the ancient city of Tlos and the nearby Yakapark. Located just 35 km from Fethiye, Tlos is one of the oldest settlements of the Lycian civilization. Visitors can explore rock tombs, an ancient amphitheater, and the remains of Roman baths, all set against the stunning backdrop of the mountains. A short drive from Tlos, Yakapark offers a lush oasis where you can relax and enjoy trout dishes by the river.

Another favorite destination is Dalyan, known for its natural mud baths, the impressive rock-cut tombs of Kaunos, and the endangered loggerhead sea turtles that nest at İztuzu Beach. A boat ride along the Dalyan River is both peaceful and visually captivating, making it one of the most rewarding Fethiye day trips.

A trip to Pamukkale is also within reach for a long day trip. Famous for its white travertine terraces and ancient city of Hierapolis, this UNESCO World Heritage site offers both a scenic and historical adventure. You can walk barefoot across the mineral-rich terraces and even bathe in Cleopatra’s Pool, where the ruins of Roman columns rest beneath the water.

One particularly unique excursion is the Dalyan Mud Bath and Turtle Beach tour, often arranged as part of a package from Fethiye. Here, you’ll coat yourself in mineral-rich mud, rinse off in a thermal spring, and then head to İztuzu Beach where sea turtles are known to nest. It’s both fun and educational, especially for families with children.

Horseback riding excursions through the countryside and along the beach also offer a more serene way to explore. These tours usually cater to all levels of experience, making them accessible and enjoyable even for beginners.
